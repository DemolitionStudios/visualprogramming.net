And the patch goes on:

We've released not one, not two, but 3 bugfix releases for vvvv gamma in January. Read all about them in The [ChangeLog]().

We've also been hard at work on making VL.Audio into a first stable release that will eventually ship with vvvv directly, ie. no more extra install only to play with audio. Normal. Read all about it in the post with the captivating title Breaking - [VL.Audio approaching stable]().

The [Mastering vvvv for teaching]() course has started. We got a whopping 42 applications which unfortunately we couldn't accommodate all. We had a tough time choosing but eventually settled on a nice blend of 20 people who are joining us from 9 different countries. Ah the joys of the modern age. If you were not chosen this time, we're hoping to have a new offer for you soon!

Oh and in case you missed it, you can still [rewatch the 16th vvvv online meetup]().
