## Free Use

vvvv can be used freely without any limitations for the following purposes:

- Evaluation
- Non-commercial use
- FOSS development
- Contribution development
- Teaching and learning vvvv

## Commercial Use

Use for any commercial purposes requires a per-developer license. Commercial use includes funded academic research or use in NPOs.

## Buy Licenses

- [vvvv beta](https://vvvv.org/documentation/licensing)
- Licenses for vvvv gamma are still to come

## T.R.U.S.T
vvvv is protected by our (pattern pending) T.R.U.S.T model:

- No copy-protection
- No feature limitations
- No mandatory registration
- We trust you to declare your commercial use of vvvv correctly.

That's the world we want to live in. We don't believe in any form of copy-protection or artificial feature limitations that usually only restrict honest users. Others will always find a way around such restrictions and thus not be bothered anyway. We're all grown-ups here. If vvvv helps you make a living, then help us make a living by providing vvvv for you. How simple is that?!
