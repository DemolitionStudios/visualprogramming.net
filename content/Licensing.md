vvvv is free for evaluation and non-commercial use.
For all commercial applications, you need to buy a license.

Commercial use means that the work done with vvvv is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

We are well aware of the fact that the distinction between commercial and non-commercial has a somehow blurry boundary. We trust the fair judgement of our users.
