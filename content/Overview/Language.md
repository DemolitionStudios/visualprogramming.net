* Combines metaphors known from dataflow, functional and object oriented programming
* Statically typed
* Strictly evaluated
* Automagic type inference
* First class support for both mutable and immutable datatypes
* Regions {{< gray "aka visual code blocks (loops, if, delegates, ...)" >}}
* Interfaces {{< gray "aka subtype polymorphism" >}}
* Generics {{< gray "aka parametric polymorphism (with bounded quantification)" >}}
* Process nodes {{< gray "aka simple lifetime management" >}}
* Adaptive nodes {{< gray "aka adhoc polymorphism" >}}
* Reactive/Async programming
* Easy multithreading
* Compiles to C# using Roslyn
* Consumes any .NET assembly by providing all methods as nodes
